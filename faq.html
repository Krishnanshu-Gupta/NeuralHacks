            <h5>Who can attend?</h5>
            <p>
              We encourage and welcome undergraduate and graduate students of
              all backgrounds to join us. Unfortunately, we are unable to admit
              high school students. DubHacks is open to students who do not
              attend the University of Washington as well!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>How much does DubHacks cost?</h5>
            <p>
              Admissions is completely free. Just bring yourself and your best
              ideas, and we take care of the rest! That means meals, drinks,
              snacks, workspace, swag, and WiFi are completely on us.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>Do you offer travel reimbursement?</h5>
            <p>
              Yes! Part of our mission is to be as inclusive as we can and to
              encourage a diverse range of students to join. That being said,
              we'd love to support you by offering travel reimbursements. Travel
              reimbursements will be assessed separately from your application
              and will be provided on a case by case basis. If you are traveling
              from Vancouver BC, a shuttle bus will be provided.
            </p>

          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>What should I bring?</h5>
            <p>
              In order to check in, you must bring a valid photo ID. You can
              also bring a laptop, chargers, toiletries, a change of clothes,
              and anything else you will need for an overnight weekend. But
              remember, DubHacks is approximately 24 hours— so be prepared to
              let loose and have fun!

          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>What is the code of conduct?</h5>
            <p>
              DubHacks values the importance of a safe and all-inclusive space.
              We welcome students from all backgrounds. Anyone attending must
              adhere to our <a href="conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.

            <h5>When do applications close?</h5>
            <p>
              Applications close September 8th, 2019 at 11:59PM (PST).

          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>What if I don’t know how to code?</h5>
            <p>
              Interest in learning and working with technology is much more
              important than your current experience level. No experience is
              needed — whether you're a coder, an artist, a designer, or a
              writer, you'll get a chance to work with various mentors, attend
              workshops, interact with companies, and learn alongside fellow
              participants.

          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>How big are the teams?</h5>
            <p>
              You may work individually or on a team of no more than four
              people. Due to the number of applications we receive, we are
              unable to admit pre-formed teams. Once you receive your
              acceptance, you will be sent an email further prompting you on our
              team formation opportunities.
            </p>

          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>How do I choose a track?</h5>
            <p>
              Upon arriving at DubHacks, you and your team will select a track
              to hack in. In order to be considered for DubHacks prizes, you
              will have to submit your project to a specific track. It's up to
              your team to decide!

          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>Are we allowed to build on past projects?</h5>
            <p>
              You cannot work, copy, or iterate on past projects. Using your own
              APIs or third-party APIs is allowed, as long as the project is
              completely new.

          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>What if I need special accommodations?</h5>
            <p>
              DubHacks aims to be accessible and welcoming for everyone. Please
              list any special accommodations in your application, or contact us
              with any other concerns!

            <p>
              We’ll provide meals from Saturday’s breakfast to Sunday’s lunch.
              If you have dietary restrictions, we’ll try our best to
              accommodate them. Of course, we’ll also have an abundance of
              snacks throughout the hacking period!

            <h5>What is HUB Games?</h5>

              HUB Games is the located on the bottom floor in our DubHacks
              space. We have rented the space from 10:00PM on Saturday and
              hackers will have access to everything from Bowling, Table Tennis,
              Pool, Video gaming (X-box, Nintendo Switch & Wii U), and even
              Board Gaming!

          <div class="faq-question">
            <h5>What do you look for in applicants?</h5>
            <p>
              Our DubHacks team aims to be as inclusive as possible. We look for
              individuals filled with passion — whether they come from a
              technical background or not. We believe that anyone and everyone
              has the power to make a difference. In our application, you get a
              chance to demonstrate your interests and past projects by sharing
              anything from your GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolios, or writing
              samples. We don't require prior hackathon experience because we
              want you to show us what makes you, YOU!
